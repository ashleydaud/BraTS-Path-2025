# MSc Project â€“ Brain Tumour Sub-Region Classification (BraTS-Path 2025)

This repository contains the code and outputs developed as part of my MSc Data Science dissertation project, where I explored deep learning approaches for **patch-level classification of glioblastoma sub-regions** using the **BraTS-Path 2025 dataset**.

The work was submitted both:  
- As my **MSc dissertation project**  
- As an official submission to the **BraTS-Path 2025 Challenge**, part of the **MICCAI International Conference**.

I am honoured that my submission was **accepted for presentation** at **MICCAI 2025 in Daejeon, South Korea**, where I was invited to present my findings as a **poster submission**.
